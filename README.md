An app to build images in the style of macOS icons. Perfect for your self-service system's catalogue (or at least perfect for mine). 

It puts a square with a solid colour and rounded corners and then layers a SFSymbol on top of the square. 

You can either export or share it as a PNG.

### Requirements

macOS 15.0 or later

### Credits

Built by Adam Anklewicz... well, mostly ChatGPT, but it's a learning experience.

For now, I'd love for you to contribute if you're interested.
